## üç∏ Bar Assistant

Bar Assistant is all-in-one solution for managing your home bar. Compared to other recipe management software that usually tries to be more for general use, Bar Assistant is made specifically for managing cocktail recipes. This means that there are a lot of cocktail-oriented features, like ingredient substitutes, first-class ingredients, ABV calculations, unit switching and more.

This repository only contains the API server, if you are looking for easy to use web client, take a look at [Salt Rim](https://github.com/karlomikus/vue-salt-rim).

## Container images

Bar Assistant is available as a Docker image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/barassistant/server) and [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/karlomikus/bar-assistant/pkgs/container/barassistant). There is no `latest` tag, so you need to specify version in the tag. For example:

- `barassistant/server:v4.4.1` - This will pull the exact version
- `barassistant/server:v4.4` - This will pull the latest minor release
- `barassistant/server:v4` - This will pull the latest major release

We recommend that you always use the latest major release, as it will always be the most stable version.
